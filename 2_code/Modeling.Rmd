## Data Modeling

This section covers the predictive modeling of listing prices based on the cleaned 
and transformed dataset prepared in the course of the exploratory analysis.

We are building four different models with increasing complexity regarding the number 
of predictors and degrees of freedom:  
1) An *intutive linear regression model* using only the subset of variables for that our 
common sense assumptions about the relationship with price were confirmed by the exploratory analysis 
(e.g. listing location, room type);  
2) A *stepwise-selected linear regression model* that applies automated variable
selection approach and may include non-obvious or weaker predictors that are still
important for predicting the price;  
3) A *full GLM model* that uses all the variables that had at least some relationship
with the price;  
4) A *full Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model* that also uses the same variables as 
the model above, but is more flexible regarding variable interactions than a regression 
model.
  
The for each of the four models, the following steps are taken:  
1) Model definition and building;  
2) Diagnostics;  
3) Analysis of model coefficients and variable importance;  
4) Evaluation of model in-sample performance.  

Afterwards, all four models are compared on out-of-sample data in order to exclude
the effects of overfitting when evaluating prediction quality.

Finally, we provide an interpretation of the most important predictors of the price
based on the learnings from comparing the model coefficients.


### Intutive Linear Regression Model

#### Model definition (which variables, describe approach)

#### Model Diagnostics (distribution of residuals), for regression, cover the following:

Are (deviance) residuals normally distributed
Is there a remaining pattern in the residuals
Are any observations highly influential on coefficients

#### Variable importance and coefficients 
(comment on p.value, the sign and magnitude) 

#### Model in-sample performance
In-sample performance: RMSE, Adj. Rsq / explained variance, AIC
